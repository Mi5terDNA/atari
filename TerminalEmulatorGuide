#Rough guide to use your Atari or other retro computer as a dumb terminal for your Mac with a USB-Serial adapter
#You'll be using 'screen' to open a serial connection between the shell host and the dumb terminal
#wnetto 4/29/20

#Launch the terminal emulator on your Atari
#Connect your USB-Serial adapter to both machines
#On the host, use whatever your serial device is after the screen command, then the baud rate you'd like to use
#screen <serial device> <baud rate>
#The serial device name can be found via ls /dev/tty.*

screen tty.usbserial-XXX 9600

#You can verify connectivity between the modern machine and the Atari by typing on either, the output should be mirrored on the other end
#Press Control+A then Shift+: on the host, then paste the line below to mirror your shell to the Atari
#Make sure your baud setting matches after the std.XXX portion

exec ::: /usr/libexec/getty std.9600

#text input will be ddoouubblleedd or tttrrriiipppllleeeddd on the host terminal output, but everything works normally on the Atari
#Obviously an 80 column terminal emulator is better for this
